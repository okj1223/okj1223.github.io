## 3. Fluid Dynamic Analysis and Engineering Calculations

### 3.1 Two-Phase Flow (Pneumatic Conveying) Analysis

#### 3.1.1 Pellet Physical Properties

**Dry Ice Pellet Characteristics**:
- Diameter: d = 2.0 mm
- Density: ρₚ = 1,560 kg/m³ 
- Individual mass: mₚ = 6.53 mg
- Sublimation temperature: -78.5°C (1 atm)

**Mass Flow Calculations**:
```
Target feed rate: 1.5 kg/min = 0.025 kg/s
Pellets per second: N = 0.025 / 6.53×10⁻⁶ = 3,826 pellets/s
Individual kinetic energy (at 100 m/s): Ek = ½mₚv² = 32.65 mJ
```

#### 3.1.2 Minimum Conveying Velocity

**Terminal Velocity Calculation**:
```
Vt = √[(4gd(ρₚ - ρf))/(3Cdρf)]
```

Where:
- d = 2.0×10⁻³ m (pellet diameter)
- ρₚ = 1,560 kg/m³ (pellet density)  
- ρf = 4.85 kg/m³ (air density at 4 bar)
- Cd = 0.44 (spherical particle, Re > 1000)

**Result**: Vt = 31.2 m/s

**Minimum Conveying Velocity**:
```
Vmin = Fl × Vt × √(ρf,std/ρf) = 1.3 × 31.2 × √(1.225/4.85) = 18.5 m/s
```

**Design Velocity**: 25.0 m/s (35% safety margin)


### 3.2 Compressible Flow Analysis

#### 3.2.1 Pressure Loss Calculations (Darcy-Weisbach)

**1″ × 50m Primary Section**:

```
Inlet conditions (compressor outlet):
P₁ = 9.01 bar (absolute), T₁ = 298 K
ρ₁ = P₁/(RT₁) = 9.01×10⁵/(287×298) = 10.54 kg/m³

Flow conditions:
Q₁ = 0.00323 m³/s (actual)
V₁ = Q₁/A₁ = 0.00323/(5.07×10⁻⁴) = 6.37 m/s

Reynolds number:
Re₁ = ρ₁V₁D₁/μ = 10.54×6.37×0.0254/(1.8×10⁻⁵) = 9.58×10⁴

Friction factor (Moody diagram): f₁ = 0.025

Pressure loss:
ΔP₁ = f₁(L/D)(ρ₁V₁²/2) = 0.025×(50/0.0254)×(10.54×6.37²/2) = 0.105 bar
```

**3/4″ × 25m Secondary Section**:

```
Flow conditions at 4 bar average:
ρ₂ = 4.76 kg/m³, V₂ = 25.2 m/s
Re₂ = 1.27×10⁵, f₂ = 0.023 (hose friction)

Air-only pressure loss:
ΔP₂,air = 0.023×(25/0.01905)×(4.76×25.2²/2) = 0.456 bar

Two-phase multiplier:
Solid loading ratio = ṁₛₒₗᵢd/ṁₐᵢᵣ = 0.025/0.034 = 0.735
Additional solid loss: ΔPₛₒₗᵢd = 1.3 × 0.735 × 0.456 = 0.436 bar
Total loss: ΔP₂,total = 0.456 + 0.436 = 0.892 bar
```

**System Total Pressure Loss**: 0.105 + 0.892 + 0.3 (fittings) = **1.3 bar**


### 3.3 Nozzle Design and Choked Flow Analysis

#### 3.3.1 Convergent-Divergent Nozzle Theory

**Isentropic Flow Relations**:
```
P/ρᵞ = constant
Critical pressure ratio: P*/P₀ = (2/(γ+1))^(γ/(γ-1)) = 0.528
```

**Design Conditions**:
- Inlet stagnation pressure: P₀ = 6.0 bar
- Inlet stagnation temperature: T₀ = 293 K
- Target mass flow: ṁ = 0.034 kg/s
- Air properties: γ = 1.4, R = 287 J/(kg·K)

#### 3.3.2 Throat Area Calculation

**Critical Conditions**:
```
P* = 0.528 × 6×10⁵ = 3.168×10⁵ Pa
T* = 293 × (2/2.4) = 244.2 K
ρ* = 3.168×10⁵/(287×244.2) = 4.52 kg/m³
a* = √(1.4×287×244.2) = 313.4 m/s
```

**Mass Flow Function**:
```
ṁ = CdA*ρ*a* = Cd × A* × 4.52 × 313.4

Required throat area:
A* = ṁ/(Cd×ρ*×a*) = 0.034/(0.9×4.52×313.4) = 2.67×10⁻⁵ m²

Equivalent diameter: d* = √(4A*/π) = 5.83 mm ≈ 6.0 mm
```

#### 3.3.3 Divergent Section Design

**Exit Geometry**:
- Slit dimensions: 10 mm × 150 mm = 1,500 mm²
- Area ratio: Ae/A* = 1.5×10⁻³/2.67×10⁻⁵ = 56.2

**Over-expansion Analysis**:
With such high area ratio, the flow becomes over-expanded:
- Exit Mach number: M ≈ 3.2 (supersonic)
- Theoretical exit velocity: 723 m/s
- **Actual velocity (with losses): ~100-120 m/s**


### 3.4 Pellet Acceleration and Heat Transfer

#### 3.4.1 Drag Force Analysis

**Newton's Second Law for Pellet Motion**:
```
mₚ(dVₚ/dt) = Fd = ½CdρfAₚ(Vf - Vₚ)|Vf - Vₚ|
```

**Characteristic Time and Distance**:
```
τ = mₚ/(½CdρfAₚ) = 6.53×10⁻⁶/(½×0.44×4.85×3.14×10⁻⁶) = 1.96×10⁻³ s
L₉₀% = Vf × τ × ln(10) = 100 × 1.96×10⁻³ × 2.3 = 0.45 m
```

**Conclusion**: Pellets reach 90% of air velocity within 45 cm from nozzle exit.


#### 3.4.2 Sublimation Analysis

**Heat Transfer Calculation**:
```
Nusselt number: Nu = 2 + 0.6Re^0.5Pr^0.33 = 64.0
Heat transfer coefficient: h = 832 W/(m²·K)
Heat transfer rate: q = hAₚ(T∞ - Ts) = 1.028 W
Sublimation rate: ṁsub = 1.8×10⁻⁶ kg/s
Complete sublimation time: 3.6 seconds
```

**Flight Time vs Sublimation**: 2-3 ms << 3.6 s → **Negligible mass loss during flight**

- **ASTM A240**: Stainless steel specifications

**Design Conditions**:
- Design pressure: P = 8 bar = 0.8 MPa
- Design temperature: T = 80°C
- Safety factor: SF = 4.0 (ASME standard)
- Material: SUS316L (σallow = 200 MPa at 80°C)

#### 4.1.2 Wall Thickness Calculation

**ASME Formula for Cylindrical Pressure Vessels**:
```
t = (P × D)/(2S × E - 1.2P)

Where:
P = 0.8 MPa (design pressure)
D = 25.4 mm (internal diameter)
S = 200 MPa (allowable stress)
E = 1.0 (weld efficiency, full penetration)

Calculation:
t = (0.8 × 25.4)/(2 × 200 × 1.0 - 1.2 × 0.8)
t = 20.32/399.04 = 0.051 mm

Required thickness: tmin = 0.051 + 0.5 (corrosion) = 0.551 mm
Actual thickness: tactual = 2.0 mm
Safety factor: 2.0/0.551 = 3.6
```


#### 4.1.3 Stress Analysis

**Operating Stresses**:
```
Hoop stress: σh = (P × D)/(2t) = (0.8 × 25.4)/(2 × 2.0) = 5.08 MPa
Axial stress: σa = (P × D)/(4t) = (0.8 × 25.4)/(4 × 2.0) = 2.54 MPa

Weld joint allowable stress:
σallow,weld = (520 MPa × 0.85)/4 = 110.5 MPa

- Critical density: ρ* = P*/(RT*) = 4.52 kg/m³
- Critical sound speed: a* = √(γRT*) = 313.4 m/s

Mass flow function:
ṁ = CdA*ρ*a* = Cd × A* × 4.52 × 313.4

Throat area calculation:
A* = ṁ/(Cd×ρ*×a*) = 0.034/(0.9×4.52×313.4) = 2.67×10⁻⁵ m²

```
Exit geometry:
- Slit dimensions: 10 mm × 150 mm
